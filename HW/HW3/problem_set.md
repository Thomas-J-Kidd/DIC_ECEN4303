## Problems

### 2.2

Calculate the flatband voltage for an «-type substrate with Nn = 5 x 1017 cm \ an Si02
insulator with tm= 2 nm, and a polysilicon gate doped «-type with Nn= 102(l ctrr3.
Assume Q'0 = 2 x 10~9 C/cm2.

### 2.3 

Produce plots like those in Figs. 2.10, 2.12, and 2.13 for NA = 5 x 1017 enr3, tm = 2 nm,
and VFB = -0.8 V.

### 2.6 

For a device with NA = 1 x 10lx cm-3, tm = 2.5 nm, and VFB = -0.752 V, plot In l^'j vs. VGB
in weak inversion, using (a) (2.6.8) with (2.6.12); (b) (2.6.26) with (2.6.27); and (r) (2.6.34)
with (2.6.35). Comment on the accuracy of the last two approaches.

### 2.7 

For NA = 3 x 1017 cm"3, fox = 6 nm, and VFB = -0.983 V, plot Q',(VGB) using (a) (2.6.8)
with (2.6.12); (b) (2.6.20), from VGB = VM0 + 0.6 V to VGB = 3 V. Comment on the accu¬
racy of (2.6.20). Assume initially (j)0 = 2(j)F + 6(j)l and modify this value if necessary to
decrease the
